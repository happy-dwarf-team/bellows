### Features

First public release. Each module is `on`, `off` or `verify` in
`anvil/data/eu4-startup-boost/config.toml` (created on first start):

* **mimalloc:** faster memory allocator for the game's C runtime
* **verifypath_listing:** answers PhysFS path checks from directory listings
* **exists_index:** answers "does this file exist" for the modifier icon check
* **metascript_subst:** single-pass `$parameter$` substitution in scripted effects
* **trigger_intern:** alternative trigger interning (off by default: slower than the game's own code with the shipped trigger profile)
* **open_warmup:** opens the files the game will need ahead of it on parallel threads, from a profile learned per mod set
* **ram_prefetch:** reads and unpacks the DLC archive members the game will need into RAM on worker threads (learned per mod set; up to ~1.5 GB RAM during start-up)
* **attr_cache:** remembers "file not found" answers for game and mod files during start-up (off by default)

Lab measurement (EU4 1.37.5 Steam, 10 UI/graphics/music mods, warm start to the main menu, 3 interleaved starts each): 34.96 s without plugins, 15.40 s with the first five modules; 12.24 s median with `ram_prefetch` in a separate series (15.16 s with it off). Game logs identical with and without the plugin; a verify run compared 3.6 million answers with the game's own code, 0 differences. Requires Anvil 0.2.0 or newer; supported game build: EU4 1.37.5 (Steam, Windows 64-bit), other builds are skipped by Anvil.
