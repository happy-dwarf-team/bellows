**Faster Europa Universalis IV start-up.** An
[Anvil](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil) plugin that makes the game
start faster, without changing game files or game behaviour. Like a smith's
bellows, it gets the forge hot sooner.

**Install guide:
[anvil.happydwarf.dev/plugins/bellows](https://anvil.happydwarf.dev/plugins/bellows/).**
Players can also subscribe on the
[Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3823747170);
the rest of Happy Dwarf Team's tools for EU4 are on
[happydwarf.dev](https://happydwarf.dev/).

Formerly **EU4 Startup Boost** (plugin id `eu4-startup-boost`, up to 0.5.0);
see [Updating from EU4 Startup Boost](#updating-from-eu4-startup-boost).

> Status: stage 2, early public releases — see
> [Releases](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/bellows/releases) and
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Bellows 0.8.0 and newer is a plugin for
> Anvil's plugin API 2 and needs **Anvil 1.0 or newer**; 0.7.0 and earlier
> need Anvil 0.2. From 0.9.0 it is also published as a Steam Workshop mod for
> Anvil 1.3 or newer (see [Steam Workshop](#steam-workshop)).
> Design: [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).

## Measured

EU4 1.37.5 (Steam, Windows 64-bit, 10 UI/graphics/music mods), warm start to
the main menu (`Running application` in `system.log`), original `eu4.exe`,
Anvil 1.5.0 and Bellows 0.10.0 from the release files, Bellows with default
settings and the profiles it learned on an earlier start, 3 interleaved
starts each, every start only after no other program had used the processor
for 15 seconds:

| Setup | Starts | Median |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Anvil without plugins | 39.24 / 38.68 / 38.44 s | 38.68 s |
| Anvil + anvil-game | 39.74 / 39.22 / 39.51 s | 39.51 s |
| Anvil + anvil-game + Bellows 0.10.0 | 12.79 / 12.24 / 12.28 s | **12.28 s** |

Bellows needs the standard plugin anvil-game, which on its own made no clear
difference (the ranges overlap). The very first start, with the profile
shipped in the release, took 12.80 s. Starts on the same day while other
programs were busy took 40–46 s without Bellows and 12.8–13.6 s with it;
they are left out of the table.

The game's `setup.log`, `error.log` and `system.log` were byte for byte the
same in all 31 starts of that day, with and without Bellows. With default settings
the modules also compare a sample of their answers with the game's own code
(about 45,700 comparisons per start): 0 differences.

### A big mod set: Anbennar

Anbennar with Proper 2K UI Enhanced and P2KE Patch - Anbennar (the Workshop
items as of 26 October 2026), warm start to the main menu, original
`eu4.exe`, Anvil 1.5.2 and Bellows 0.14.0 from the release files, Bellows with
default settings and the profiles it learned on earlier starts, 5 interleaved
starts each, in a separate game profile with no other game running:

| Setup | Starts | Median |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Without Anvil | 85.32 / 87.19 / 84.64 / 85.29 / 86.01 s | 85.32 s |
| Anvil + anvil-game + Bellows 0.14.0 | 22.42 / 21.81 / 21.83 / 22.47 / 23.01 s | **22.42 s** |

About 10 s of that gain comes from `metascript_blocks` (0.14.0), which matters
for Anbennar's large scripted effects and makes no difference on the 10-mod set
above. The game's logs were the same in all five pairs of starts. The first
start after a reboot was not measured on this mod set.

### Measure your own

Anvil 1.5 or newer has a **Benchmark** tab in the Anvil Manager
(`AnvilManager.exe` in the game folder). It starts the game again and again,
without Bellows and with it in turn; each start quits by itself once the game
is ready, and nothing in your saves, mods or `anvil.toml` changes. The tab
shows the median and spread per setup, and the cold starts (after a reboot)
the series happened to contain, separately. You can then send the report to
the Anvil project, after seeing exactly what is sent, or copy it into a
[performance report](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/bellows/issues/new?template=performance_report.yml).
Bellows 0.10.0 and newer adds its module states and counters to the report.

Benchmark times run to `anvil-game.ready`, the end of start-up, so they are
about 1.5 s longer than the times above, which stop at `Running application`.

## Modules

| Module | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `mimalloc` | Faster memory allocator for the game's C runtime until the main menu (`startup`, the default; later allocations use the Windows heap), or for the whole session (`on`, which made the simulation about 5% slower in the lab) |
| `verifypath_listing` | Answers PhysFS path checks from directory listings |
| `exists_index` | Answers "does this file exist" for the modifier icon check |
| `trigger_intern` | Faster trigger interning at the end of loading (~0.4 s instead of ~0.6 s for the game's own code with the shipped trigger profile; a `config.toml` written by 0.3.0 or earlier said `trigger_intern = "off"`, and the migration keeps that: delete the line from `settings.toml` to use the default `"on"`) |
| `metascript_subst` | Single-pass `$parameter$` substitution in scripted effects |
| `metascript_blocks` | Single-pass resolution of the `[[parameter] ...]` blocks of scripted effects and triggers (matters for mods with large scripted effects, e.g. Anbennar) |
| `open_warmup` | Opens the files the game will need ahead of it on parallel threads, from a profile learned per mod set (big gain on the first start after a reboot) |
| `ram_prefetch` | Reads and unpacks the DLC archive members the game will need into RAM on worker threads (learned per mod set; uses up to 1 GB of extra RAM during start-up, setting `ram_prefetch_budget_mb`) |
| `attr_cache` | Remembers "file not found" answers for game and mod files during start-up (off by default: ~0.1 s left next to the other modules) |
| `token_dict_cache` | Caches the script tokenizer's keyword lookups (~0.4 s) |
| `range_witness` | **Simulation, not start-up.** Answers the country range check from the province that was in range last time instead of walking all of the country's provinces again; same answers as the game's code (lab: a year at speed 5 in 20.6 s instead of 27.6 s). `"verify"` compares every answer with the game's and writes the first mismatches to `range_witness_mismatches.tsv` |
| `modifier_merge` | **Simulation, off by default.** Adds large modifier lists (each country's modifiers to every unit's in the monthly update) with an index instead of a scan per entry: the same entries, order, values and memory growth as the game's code. `"verify"` runs the game's merge and compares. Lab: 10.1 µs a merge against 1.08 µs, so about 0.7 s less in the merge per game year (about 3% of a year at speed 5 in 1720, 2% in 1821); 1.5 million merges compared with the game's, all the same. SIMULATION: the year 1720 in 19.45 s instead of 20.64 s (medians, p = 0.02); in 1821 the same direction, not conclusive |
| `frame_pacing` | **Simulation, on by default since 0.15.** At the fastest speed, draws frames from inside the daily tick less often while you do nothing (setting `frame_pacing_interval_ms`, 100 ms; the game's own is 50 ms), and at once when a key press, click or wheel turn waits (`frame_pacing_input = "draw"`). The simulation is the same; the map updates about 16 instead of 22 times a second at speed 5 while you do nothing (lab: a year at speed 5 in 20.8 s instead of 23.4 s; a key press at speed 5 handled after 21 ms instead of 51.5 ms in the median, a real key press after 21.6 ms instead of 56.8 ms) |

Diagnostics, off by default: `zip_profile`, `token_dict_profile`,
`range_profile`, `tick_profile` (time of each stage of the daily, monthly and
yearly tick per game day), `army_search_profile` (calls, time and repeated
answers of the AI army search), `score_probe` (how often the inputs of the AI
search's scoring functions repeat within a game day), `monthly_probe` (time of
the monthly tick's loops, modifier merges and random draws per context).

Supported game build: EU4 1.37.5 (Steam, Windows 64-bit). Every game address
is declared in [`plugin/symbols.toml`](plugin/symbols.toml); Anvil checks
them against `eu4.exe` before it loads Bellows, and on another build (or any
mismatch) skips the plugin with the reason in `anvil/anvil.log` and the game
starts normally.

## Settings

Each module is a setting `on`, `off` or (where the module has it) `verify`,
plus `ram_prefetch_budget_mb` (64–8192), `frame_pacing_interval_ms`
(0–1000; 0 keeps the game's own interval) and `frame_pacing_input` (`draw`, the
default, or `wait`, the 0.12.0 behaviour); the defaults, labels and
descriptions are in [`plugin/settings.toml`](plugin/settings.toml). Your
values go into `anvil/data/bellows/settings.toml`, one line each, only those
that differ from the default, for example:

```toml
attr_cache = "on"
ram_prefetch_budget_mb = 2048
```

Every setting applies at the next start. For one start, an environment
variable overrides it: `ANVIL_BELLOWS_<NAME>`, e.g.
`ANVIL_BELLOWS_EXISTS_INDEX=verify` (Anvil logs each override). The plugin
writes its counters to `anvil/anvil.log` when the game is ready.

**From 0.7.0 or earlier:** on its first start Bellows moves your
`anvil/data/bellows/config.toml` to `settings.toml` (values that differ from
the defaults; `[ram_prefetch] budget_mb` becomes `ram_prefetch_budget_mb`)
and keeps the old file as `config.toml.migrated`; `anvil/anvil.log` says what
was moved or left out. The `EU4SB_<NAME>` variables are no longer read: use
`ANVIL_BELLOWS_<NAME>` (a set `EU4SB_` variable is named in the log).

## Install / uninstall

Install [Anvil](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil#install--uninstall)
1.0 or newer first (it includes the `anvil-game` plugin Bellows needs). Then
download `bellows-windows-x64.zip` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/bellows/releases/latest)
and extract it into `<EU4>/anvil/plugins/`; it contains the `bellows`
folder (`SHA256SUMS.txt` next to the archive holds its checksum). Delete that
folder to uninstall.

### Updating from EU4 Startup Boost

Delete `<EU4>/anvil/plugins/eu4-startup-boost/` and extract Bellows as above.
On its first start Bellows moves your settings and learned profiles from
`anvil/data/eu4-startup-boost/` to `anvil/data/bellows/` (and the settings
from `config.toml` to `settings.toml`, see [Settings](#settings)). Anvil 1.0
does not load the old plugin (plugin API 1); Bellows mentions the leftover
folder in `anvil/anvil.log`. The exported `EU4SB_*` counters keep their
names.

## Building

Visual Studio 2022 (or Build Tools) with the C++ workload, CMake ≥ 3.28, Git
(fetches mimalloc 3.5.3, toml++ 3.4.0 and the Anvil SDK).

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
cmake --install build --config Release --component plugin --prefix dist
```

The plugin folder as Anvil loads it is `build/plugin/bellows/`. The Anvil SDK
(the `AnvilPlugin` CMake package, its headers and `anvil.exe`) is the SDK
archive of the Anvil release `SB_ANVIL_VERSION` in `CMakeLists.txt` (1.4.0),
downloaded by the first configure and checked against its SHA-256. Use an
unpacked SDK archive, or one installed from a local Anvil checkout, with
`-DAnvilPlugin_DIR=<sdk>/cmake`. After changing
`plugin/symbols.toml`, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#game-addresses).

Contributions, the commit convention and the release process: see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Steam Workshop

Bellows can also be published as a Steam Workshop mod for Anvil 1.3 or newer,
which loads plugins from enabled mods after the player approves each version.
The mod is the `workshop/` folder ([`workshop.toml`](workshop.toml)):
`descriptor.mod`, `thumbnail.png` and `anvil/bellows/`, the plugin folder of a
release, which is not in Git. [`workshop/description.md`](workshop/description.md)
is the item's description: every publish replaces the description on Steam with
it. `checksum = "keep"` makes the publish fail if the mod would change the game's
checksum.

- Every pull request runs a dry run of
  [paradox-workshop-publish](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/paradox-workshop-publish)
  (`pdx-ws`) in `build.yml`: the job summary shows the files, the descriptor and
  the rendered description. It needs no secrets.
- [`workshop-publish.yml`](.github/workflows/workshop-publish.yml) runs when a
  release is published. It downloads that release's `bellows-windows-x64.zip`,
  checks its build attestation, unpacks `bellows/` into `workshop/anvil/bellows/`
  and publishes the mod, with the release notes as the change note.
- To update the Workshop page between releases, run it by hand on `main`
  with the latest release:
  `gh workflow run workshop-publish.yml --ref main -f tag=vX.Y.Z`. It publishes
  that release's package again with `main`'s `workshop/` folder, and fails when
  `main`'s descriptor version is not that release's (for example while a newer
  release is still a draft). Steam keeps the mod's version when the files are
  unchanged and records no change note, but takes the new description.

Setting it up, once (maintainers):

1. **Install `pdx-ws`** from its
   [releases](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/paradox-workshop-publish/releases)
   ([setup guide](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/paradox-workshop-publish/blob/main/docs/guide/setup.md)).
2. **Create the Workshop item** on a computer with Steam running and logged in to
   the account that owns EU4 and will own the item. Build the plugin package, put
   its `bellows/` folder into the mod and check the plan first:

   ```powershell
   cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
   cmake --build build --config Release
   cmake --install build --config Release --component plugin --prefix dist/package
   Remove-Item workshop/anvil -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction Ignore
   New-Item -ItemType Directory workshop/anvil -Force | Out-Null
   Copy-Item dist/package/bellows workshop/anvil/bellows -Recurse
   pdx-ws plan
   pdx-ws init
   ```

   `pdx-ws init` (client mode, through the Steam client) creates a **private**
   item with the descriptor's name and tags, the preview and the description,
   uploads the mod and writes `remote_file_id` into `workshop/descriptor.mod`.
   Commit that line through a pull request. Make the item public on Steam when it
   is ready: publishing never changes its visibility.
3. **Share the Steam session** with this repository. The session is kept once,
   as the organization secrets `STEAM_SESSION` and `STEAM_USERNAME`, for the
   Happy Dwarf Team repositories that publish to the Workshop (read the
   [security notes](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/paradox-workshop-publish/blob/main/docs/guide/security.md)
   and the [organization setup](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/paradox-workshop-publish/blob/main/docs/guide/setup.md#several-repositories-in-one-organization)
   first). Add this repository to both secrets, and create a `steam-workshop`
   environment without secrets of its own:

   ```sh
   id=$(gh api repos/happy-dwarf-team/bellows --jq .id)
   gh api --method PUT orgs/happy-dwarf-team/actions/secrets/STEAM_SESSION/repositories/$id
   gh api --method PUT orgs/happy-dwarf-team/actions/secrets/STEAM_USERNAME/repositories/$id
   gh api --method PUT repos/happy-dwarf-team/bellows/environments/steam-workshop
   ```

   In **Settings → Environments → steam-workshop**, add a required reviewer and
   allow only the tags `v*` and the branch `main` (for the manual run): the
   environment gates every publish job.
4. **Turn publishing on:** `gh variable set WORKSHOP_PUBLISH --body true`.

From then on, publishing a release's draft (see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#versions-and-releases)) also publishes the
Workshop mod. When the Steam session expires, the job fails with exit code 3:
export a new one into the organization secret, for every repository that uses
it (Git Bash or PowerShell 7.4+, so the pipe passes the session unchanged):

```sh
pdx-ws session export --user my_steam_name | gh secret set STEAM_SESSION --org happy-dwarf-team --visibility selected --repos bellows,tongs,eu4-anbennar-widescreen-loading-screens
```
